# Backup and restore  

All your selections are stored in Chrome browser local storage. 

You can save/backup your highlights and notes, and then restore them in the same or in the other browser with [highlighter.pro](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/highlighterpro/gpdhplhmppgenpnkfilghnjiodfmnoap) extension installed. 

When you restore data from a backup file, the data from it is added to those already contained in this browser, without deleting existing ones.
