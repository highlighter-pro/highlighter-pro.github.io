# Highlighter.pro 

**[Highlighter.pro](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/highlighterpro/gpdhplhmppgenpnkfilghnjiodfmnoap)** is a Chrome extension for highlighting text on webpages and (optionally) adding notes to highlights. It works like a marker for web pages.

It's *very* fast, very lightweight and does not overload your browser with heavy scripts.

It's open sourced. You can see its code on [GitHub](https://github.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/highlighter-pro/highlighter). 

And you can install it from the code repo as well as from [Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/highlighterpro/gpdhplhmppgenpnkfilghnjiodfmnoap)

It does not transfer your highlights and notes to remote server and does not require permission to send/receive data to Internet.
